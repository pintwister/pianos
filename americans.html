    <P><IMG

    size=+2>It</FONT></I> was a glorious morning. The sun was shining and the 
    wind was from the southeast. Up especially early, a tall, bony, redheaded 
    young Virginian found time to buy a new thermometer, for which he paid three 
    pounds, fifteen shillings. He also bought gloves for Martha, his wife, who 
    was ill at home.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Thomas 
    Jefferson arrived early at the statehouse. The temperature was 72.5: and the 
    horseflies weren't nearly so bad at that hour. It was a lovely room, very 
    large, with gleaming white walls. The chairs were comfortable. Facing the 
    single door were two brass fireplaces, but they would not be used today.</B> 

    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>The 
    moment the door was shut, and it was always kept locked, the room became an 
    oven. The tall windows were shut, so that loud quarreling voices could not 
    be heard by passersby. Small openings atop the windows allowed a slight stir 
    of air, and also a large number of horseflies. Jefferson records that "the 
    horseflies were dexterous in finding necks, and the silk of stocking was as 
    nothing to them." All discussion was punctuated by the slap of hands on 
    necks.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>On 
    the wall at the back, facing the President's desk, was a panoply--consisting 
    of a drum, swords, and banners seized from Fort Ticonderoga the previous 
    year. Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold had captured the place, shouting that 
    they were taking it "in the name if the Great Jehovah and the Continental 
    Congress!"</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Now 
    Congress got to work, promptly taking up an emergency measure about which 
    there was discussion but no dissension. "Resolved: That an application be 
    made to the Committee of Safety of Pennsylvania for a supply of flints for 
    the troops at New York."</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Then 
    Congress transformed itself into a committee of the whole, The Declaration 
    of Independence was read aloud once more, and debate resumed. Though 
    Jefferson was the best writer of all of them, he had been somewhat verbose. 
    Congress hacked the excess away. They did a good job, as a side-by-side 
    comparison of the rough draft and the final text shows. They cut the phrase 
    "by a self-assumed power." "Climb" was replaced by "must read," then "must" 
    was eliminated, then the whole sentence, and soon the whole paragraph was 
    cut. Jefferson groaned as they continued what he later called "their 
    depredations." "Inherent and inalienable rights" came out "certain 
    unalienable rights," and to this day no one knows who suggested the elegant 
    change.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>A 
    total of 86 alterations were made. Almost 500 words were eliminated, leaving 
    1,337. At last, after three days of wrangling, the document was put to a 
    vote.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Here 
    in this hall Patrick Henry had once thundered: "I am no longer a Virginian, 
    Sir, but an American." But today the loud, sometimes bitter argument 
    stilled, and without fanfare the vote was taken from north to south by 
    colonies, as was the custom. On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of 
    Independence was adopted.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>There 
    were no trumpets blown. No one stood on his chair and cheered. The afternoon 
    was waning and Congress had no thought of delaying the full calendar of 
    routine business on its hands. For several hours they worked on many other 
    problems before adjourning for the day.</B>

    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>What 
    kind of men were the 56 signers who adopted the Declaration of Independence 
    and who, by their signing, committed an act of treason against the Crown? To 
    each of you the names Franklin, Adams, Hancock, and Jefferson are almost as 
    familiar as household words. Most of us, however, know nothing of the other 
    signers. Who were they? What happened to them?</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>I 
    imagine that many of you are somewhat surprised at the names not there: 
    George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Patrick Henry. All were 
    elsewhere.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Ben 
    Franklin was the only really old man. Eighteen were under 40; three were in 
    their 20s. Of the 56, almost half--24--were judges and lawyers. Eleven were 
    merchants, 9 were land-owners and farmers, and the remaining 12 were 
    doctors, ministers, and politicians.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>With 
    only a few exceptions, such as Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, these were men 
    of substantial property. All but two had families. The vast majority were 
    men of education and standing in their communities. They had economic 
    security as few men had in the 18th century.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Each 
    had more to lose from revolution than he had to gain by it. John Hancock, 
    one of the richest men in America, already had a price of 500 pounds on his 
    head. He signed in enormous letter so "that his Majesty could now read his 
    name without glasses and could now double the reward." Ben Franklin wryly 
    noted: "Indeed we must all hang together, otherwise we shall most assuredly 
    hang separately." Fat Benjamin Harrison of Virginia told tiny Elbridge Gerry 
    of Massachusetts: "With me it will all be over in a minute, but you, you 
    will be dancing on air an hour after I am gone."</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>These 
    men knew what they risked. The penalty for treason was death by hanging. And 
    remember: a great British fleet was already at anchor in New York 
    Harbor.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>They 
    were sober men. There were no dreamy-eyed intellectuals or draft card 
    burners here. They were far from hot-eyed fanatics, yammering for an 
    explosion. They simply asked for the status quo. It was change they 
    resisted. It was equality with the mother country they desired. It was 
    taxation with representation they sought. They were all conservatives, yet 
    they rebelled.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>It 
    was principle, not property, that had brought these men to Philadelphia. Two 
    of them became presidents of the United States. Seven of them became state 
    governors. One died in office as vice president of the United States. 
    Several would go on to be U.S. Senators. One, the richest man in America, in 
    1828 founded the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. One, a delegate from 
    Philadelphia, was the only real poet, musician and philosopher of the 
    signers (it was he, Francis Hopkinson--not Betsy Ross--who designed the 
    United States flag).</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Richard 
    Henry Lee, a delegate from Virginia, had introduced the resolution to adopt 
    the Declaration of Independence in June of 1776. He was prophetic is his 
    concluding remarks:</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>"Why 
    then sir, why do we longer delay? Why still deliberate? Let this happy day 
    give birth to an American Republic. Let her arise not to devastate and to 
    conquer but to reestablish the reign of peace and law. The eyes of Europe 
    are fixed upon us. She demands of us a living example of freedom that may 
    exhibit a contrast in the felicity of the citizen to the ever increasing 
    tyranny which desolates her polluted shores. She invites us to prepare an 
    asylum where the unhappy may find solace, and the persecuted repose. If we 
    are not this day wanting in our duty, the names of the American legislators 
    of 1776 will be placed by posterity at the side of all of those whose memory 
    has been and ever will be dear to virtuous men and good citizens."</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>Though 
    the resolution was formally adopted July 4, it was not until July 8 that two 
    of the states authorized their delegates to sign, and it was not until 
    August 2 that the signers met at Philadelphia to actually put their names to 
    the Declaration.</B> 
    <P><IMG 
    src="Americans/space.gif"><B>William 
    Ellery, delegate from Rhode Island, was curious to see the signers' faces as 
    they committed this supreme act of personal courage. He saw some men sign 
    quickly, "but in no face was he able to discern real fear." Stephen Hopkins, 
    Ellery's colleague from Rhode Island, was a man past 60. As he signed with a 
    shaking pen, he declared: "My hand trembles, but my heart does not."</B>

    before the list was published, the British marked down every member of 
    Congress suspected of having put his name to treason. All of them became the 
    objects of vicious manhunts. Some were taken. Some, like Jefferson, had 
    narrow escapes. All who had property or families near British strongholds 
    suffered.</B>

    home to see his dying wife. Hessian soldiers rode after him, and he escaped 
    in the woods. While his wife lay on her deathbed, the soldiers ruined his 
    farm and wrecked his Homestead. Hart, 65, slept in caves and woods as he was 
    hunted across the countryside. When at long last, emaciated by hardship, he 
    was able to sneak home, he found his wife had already been buried, and his 
    13 children taken away. He never saw them again. He died a broken man in 
    1779, without ever finding his family.</B>

    The family found refuge with friends, but a sympathizer betrayed them. Judge 
    Stockton was pulled from bed in the night and brutally beaten by the 
    arresting soldiers. Thrown into a common jail, he was deliberately starved. 
    Congress finally arranged for Stockton's parole, but his health was ruined. 
    The judge was released as an invalid, when he could no longer harm the 
    British cause. He returned home to find his estate looted and did not live 
    to see the triumph of the evolution. His family was forced to live off 
    charity.</B>

    cross the Delaware at Trenton. In the process he lost 150 ships at sea, 
    bleeding his own fortune and credit almost dry.</B>

    in a strongly loyalist area of Pennsylvania. When he came out for 
    independence, most of his neighbors and even some of his relatives 
    ostracized him. He was a sensitive and troubled man, and many believed this 
    action killed him. When he died in 1777, his last words to his tormentors 
    were: "Tell them that they will live to see the hour when they shall 
    acknowledge it [the signing] to have been the most glorious service that I 
    rendered to my country."</B>

    of the Virginia military forces. With British General Charles Cornwallis in 
    Yorktown, fire from 70 heavy American guns began to destroy Yorktown piece 
    by piece. Lord Cornwallis and his staff moved their headquarters into 
    Nelson's palatial home. While American cannonballs were making a shambles of 
    the town, the house of Governor Nelson remained untouched. Nelson turned in 
    rage to the American gunners and asked, "Why do you spare my home?" They 
    replied, "Sir, out of respect to you." Nelson cried, "Give me the cannon!" 
    and fired on his magnificent home himself, smashing it to bits. But Nelson's 
    sacrifice was not quite over. He had raised $2 million for the Revolutionary 
    cause by pledging his own estates. When the loans came due, a newer 
    peacetime Congress refused to honor them, and Nelson's property was 
    forfeited. He was never reimbursed. He died, impoverished, a few years later 
    at the age of 50.</B>

    those 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence, nine died of wounds or 
    hardships during the war. Five were captured and imprisoned, in each case 
    with brutal treatment. Several lost wives, sons or entire families. One lost 
    his 13 children. Two wives were brutally treated. All were at one time or 
    another the victims of manhunts and driven from their homes. Twelve signers 
    had their homes completely burned. Seventeen lost everything they owned. Yet 
    not one defected or went back on his pledged word. Their honor, and the 
    nation they sacrificed so much to create, is still intact.</B>

    captured and sent to the infamous British prison hulk afloat in New York 
    harbor known as the hell ship "Jersey," where 11,000 American captives were 
    to die. The younger Clarks were treated with a special brutality because of 
    their father. One was put in solitary and given no food. With the end almost 
    in sight, with the war almost won, no one could have blamed Abraham Clark 
    for acceding to the British request when they offered him his sons' lives if 
    he would recant and come out for the King and parliament. The utter despair 
    in this man's heart, the anguish in his very soul, must reach out to each 
    one of us down through 200 years with his answer: "No."</B>
